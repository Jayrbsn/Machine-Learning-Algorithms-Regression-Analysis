# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-Regression-Analysis
For this task I was to use a diabetes dataset to perform linear regression to find the best fit line through the data without using the linear_model.LinearRegression() function

## Project Details

### Description:
HyperionDev provided me with a diabetes dataset that I needed to use to perform linear regression to find the best fit line through the data without using the linear_model.LinearRegression() function. Instead, I was asked to write a function and make use of numpy to calculate the gradient and the y-intercept of the best fit line, which has equation y = mx + b. 

### Functionality:
Based on the outcome values from the above I was to produce a figure with the following:

 - Scatter plot of training data colored red.

 - Scatter plot of testing data colored green.

 - Line graph for the best-fit line colored blue.

 - A graph legend.

### Usefulness:
This project could be used as an efficient program for a research organisation trying to make predictions of values within a continuous range

### Contributors:
This was a solo project as a requirement for the Hyperion bootcamp. However, the mentors from Hyperion Development have reviewed and overseen all of my work and provided me with some extra guidance in trying to understand the maths behind this type of machine learning.
